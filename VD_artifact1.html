In this project I used the program photoshop to make my aesthetic vibe. I added pictures from pinterest and downloaded them to my desktop. I started by researching what I would use to describe myself. I used pictures that called out to me from pinterest. For example, I researched certain books, items and places.I included dark pictures because i like the dark mysterious vibe. Overall, I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it's my interest with items that I like and what I think describes me in pictures.
