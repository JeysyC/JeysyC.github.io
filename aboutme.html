<p>Brief summary of me!</p>
<p>My name is <b>Jeysy</b> </p>
<p>I like <b>reading</b> and <b> video games </b>and I attend Beca and am a senior.</p>


 
<p>I started to know myself more during and after Covid-19</p>
<p> I started reading by starting a book from Colleen Hoover and see what the hype was about since i would always hear about her. I would be reading Wattpad stories where I would see her mentioned in the comments and I would also hear about her on tiktok </p>
